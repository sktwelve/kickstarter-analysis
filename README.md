# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Our client Louise is requesting data on other kickstarters to compare the relationship between their launch dates and their funding goals. In order to fulfill her request, I created 2 charts based on launch dates and goals to draw conclusions and use them to our advantage. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
